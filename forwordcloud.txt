Teachers helped children with their mental health and depression. “We have to be building in more spaces for mental health.”(Article, Natasha Singer) that’s what teachers say. They comforted those who lost their close ones because of the epidemic. But now they think this is not sustainable at all.
After interviewing some teachers like, Mr Arsenie said, "In the greater context of the pandemic, who cares about photosynthesis?", their feelings and concerns can be understood. An executive order considering their situation for their benefit was issued in the state of Minnesota, that restricted schools from “teaching offline and conducting remote students” simultaneously. As the future of thousands of children and a whole generation of teachers is at stake, I agree that teachers need to be given ample incentive and attention.
